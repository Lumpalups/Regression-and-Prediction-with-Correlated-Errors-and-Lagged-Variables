# Regression-and-Prediction-with-Correlated-Errors-and-Lagged-Variables

Addressed critical challenges in regression and prediction with autocorrelated errors and lagged variables. Tackled the detection and correction of autocorrelation in errors, explored advanced approaches for prediction in the presence of correlated errors, and underscored the importance of lagged variables in time series models, improving understanding of temporal dynamics and predictive accuracy
